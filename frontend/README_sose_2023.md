# Project Mediacreation 2023 - Developing an App for students
Are you tired of being a student who's always disorganized and lacking motivation? Well, we can't promise we'll make you a straight-A student, but we can definitely help you out with this app!

## Project Description
We're developing a prototype app to help students stay motivated, organized, and ultimately successful. With features like goal-setting, progress tracking, and reminders, we're hoping to take some of the stress out of student life.

## Skills Learned
Joining our team would have been amazing if we were looking for new members, but we're not! However, we can still tell you that by working on this project, you would have gained some valuable skills like app development, teamwork, and being able to tolerate bad jokes.

## Technologies Used
Flutter is our chosen framework because, let's face it, we just love a good pun. Plus, it's a great way to develop visually appealing and high-performance apps that work on both iOS and Android devices.

## Team Roles
As we said earlier, the team is already complete. But, if we had needed help, we would have been looking for a project manager, technician, and content creator. Also, someone who laughs at our bad jokes would have been great.

## Future Work
Since we haven't started the project yet, there's a lot of work to do! We plan on working closely with a psychologist to develop a prototype technology that follows scientific standards. Once we have a working prototype, we'll optimize and test the app further to make sure it's helping students in the best way possible. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be able to retire as billionaires.

## Contributing
Sorry, we lied earlier, contributing is actually not a thing. We just wanted to sound official.
