# Releaf Student Helper App

Releaf is an app designed to help students manage their mental health while studying. Ir provides a variety of features to accomplish this, including a study timer, a place to write down your accomplishments, and a large psycho-education section with lots of articles, videos and podcasts about learning, stress management, mental health and more.
